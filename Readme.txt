Python implementation of Q-Learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm. This example demonstrates Q-Learning using a simple grid world environment where an agent learns to navigate to a goal while avoiding obstacles.
Environment:The GridWorld class defines a simple grid environment with a start, goal, and obstacles.
The agent can move up, down, left, or right.
Q-Learning:
The q_learning function implements the Q-learning algorithm.
It uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation.
